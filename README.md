# Optimizing Productivity with Obsidian: Combining GTD Method and Kanban Boards

In today's digital world, effective task and project management is essential for staying productive and organized. Obsidian, as a powerful note-taking tool, offers remarkable flexibility for integrating personalized organization systems. In this article, we'll explore how to combine the GTD (Getting Things Done) method with Kanban boards in Obsidian to create a robust and intuitive organizational system.

## Foundations of the GTD Method

The GTD method, developed by David Allen, is a time and task management approach that helps organize and prioritize your projects and activities more effectively. It's based on the idea of moving planned tasks and ideas out of your mind and into an external system, freeing mental space and reducing stress.

## Advantages of Kanbans

Kanban boards, on the other hand, offer a visual way to track the progress of tasks and projects. They allow you to visualize workflow, limit work-in-progress, and improve efficiency.

Combining GTD and Kanban in Obsidian, this combination leverages the flexibility of linked notes and visualizations to effectively manage your tasks. 

## Here’s how you can set up this system:

1) Inbox : Start by creating an "Inbox" note or folder where you'll capture all your initial tasks and ideas.

2) Task Categorization : Create categories like "Actionable" and "Non-Actionable," "Waiting," and "Projects." This will help you sort and prioritize tasks.

3) Using Kanbans : For each project or task category, use a Kanban board to track its progress. Obsidian allows you to integrate Kanban boards directly into your notes.

4) References and Archives : Organize your reference documents and archives in subfolders for easy access and better organization.
